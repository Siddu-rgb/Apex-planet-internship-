      <h2>ðŸ“š What Have I Learned?</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, I've explored various programming languages and technologies, each one helping me understand the tech world from different perspectives. Here's a quick summary of what I've learned:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>C:</strong> My starting point into programming. It taught me how computers think, work with memory, and perform operations at a low level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C++:</strong> Building on C, I discovered object-oriented programming and began to understand how powerful structured code can be.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Python:</strong> I love how clean and readable Python is. It helped me think more logically, and Iâ€™ve used it for scripting, automation, and problem-solving.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Java:</strong> A powerful language that introduced me to application-level programming. It's been great for learning about class-based structures and scalable solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web Development:</strong> This is where my passion truly lies. Designing and developing websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern tools is what excites me most. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive, visually appealing experiences.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Among all these, <strong>web development is my main preference</strong>. I love crafting user-friendly interfaces, responsive layouts, and bringing interactivity to life. The blend of creativity and logic makes web development feel like both a science and an art.
